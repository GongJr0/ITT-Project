\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

\noindent We believe that our findings provide beneficial insights into the casual relationship between firm productivity and international trade.
Our results verifies the self selection hypothesis of Meliz by showing that labor productivity distribution of exporters is significantly different from that of non-exporters across all levels of quantiles.
Moreover, we find that some firm size differences within exporters and non-exporters show no significant difference in productivity.
This is contrary to intuitive expectations and further research on the topic can be beneficial.
Estimating the magnitue of the effects in depth by employing different methodologies might provide fruitful insights.
Future studies can be carried out on firm level data from different countries to see whether the findings hold true in different economic contexts.
Overall, we believe that distributional equality is a very simple and applicable method of testing, analyzing, and displaying the trade--productivity relationship.
