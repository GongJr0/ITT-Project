\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

The first course of action is the verification of \hyperref[hyp]{H1}.
Therefore, we compare the aGVA observations of all quantile levels for exporters and non-exporters.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \label{fig:ks_table_all_firms}
    \begin{tabular}{lcc}
        \toprule
        $Q_i$ & $p$-value & Equality Conclusion \\
        \midrule
        $Q_{10}$ & $\approx 0$ & Reject $H_0$ \\
        $Q_{25}$ & $\approx 0$ & Reject $H_0$ \\
        $Q_{50}$ & $\approx 0$ & Reject $H_0$ \\
        $Q_{75}$ & $\approx 0$ & Reject $H_0$ \\
        $Q_{90}$ & $\approx 0$ & Reject $H_0$ \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}

\end{table}

\noindent As expected, and demonstrated in literature, we observe a strong statistical evidence of productivity difference in the UK market.
However, seeing a significant difference with all categories included does not guarantee a difference will be observed when sub-categories are tested separately.

We then explore the productivity differences between domestic and foreign-owned (not necessarily multinational) firms' export status.
For all quantiles, foreign/domestic owned exporters and non-exporters are compared for equality.
