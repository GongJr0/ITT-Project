    \noindent In this paper, we investigate the theoretical proposition of Melitz regarding the relationships between international trade and labor productivity.
    We use categorized data from the UK to compare labor productivity distributions of exporters and non-exporters.
    Our findings demonstrate that there is a statistically significant difference in labor productivity distributions between exporters and non-exporters across all quantiles and categories tested.
