    \noindent In this paper, we investigate the theoretical proposition of Melitz regarding the relationships between international trade and labor productivity.
    \noindent We use firm-level data from the UK to compare labor productivity distributions of exporters and non-exporters.
    \noindent Our findings demonstrate that there is a statistically significant difference in labor productivity distributions between exporters and non-exporters across all quantiles.
